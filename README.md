# Data Science & Analytics Internship Projects

This repository contains three completed tasks from the Data Science & Analytics Internship at DevelopersHub Corporation.

## ‚úÖ Tasks Completed

### 1. Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset
- **Objective**: Visualize relationships between features of the Iris dataset.
- **Tools**: pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- **Output**: Pair plots, histograms, box plots

### 2. Credit Risk Prediction
- **Objective**: Predict loan default using classification.
- **Dataset**: [Kaggle - Loan Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/altruistdelhite04/loan-prediction-problem-dataset)
- **Model**: Logistic Regression
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix

### 3. Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction
- **Objective**: Predict which customers will accept a personal loan offer.
- **Dataset**: Simulated version of the [UCI Bank Marketing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing)
- **Model**: Decision Tree Classifier
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix
